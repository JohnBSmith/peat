## Programming language Peat

Experimental project with the following goals:

* Syntax almost identical to Rust and similar naming.
* Polymorphic types (generic types) and traits.
* Compiles into polymorhic code (no monomorphisation).
* Dynamic loading of modules.
* Reference counted objects instead of garbage collection.
* Error types instead of raising exceptions.
